  title: About Rasmus Nordling ‚Ä¢ Designer & Developer in LA

I‚Äôm Rasmus Nordling, a programmer, musician, and content creator from Sweden who enjoy most creative endevaours, as you might have gathered from looking around this site.

Besides writing about my life, I'm also known for playing music and writing [songs](https://soundcloud.com/happystinson/sets/original-songs), making videos for [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@BangersNBiz), improving the world through code, [capturing the moment](https://www.flickr.com/people/ras-nordling/), and challenging my body and mind.

I also nurture my self-care through meditation, exploring new places, and being present in nature.

I'm a Libra, [INTP](https://www.mbtionline.com/en-US/MBTI-Types/INTP), and a [Questioner](https://gretchenrubin.com/four-tendencies/).<br />
I don't like staying in the same place for too long. Right now I'm calling Stockholm home, and here you can see all places [I've lived](/posts/notes/places-ive-lived/).

## Dream BIG

**On a journey to accomplish my Dreams.**<br />
This website is all about getting the most out of life. I began sharing my thoughts on achieving goals and life design in October 2016.

The purpose is to create a layer of accountability and hopefully inspire you to take action in an area where you'd like to see change.
Perhaps you are just looking for motivation or different ideas and perspectives.

I am doing this partly as a pet project, partly because writing is quite therapeutical. I'm also writing to inspire others to constantly improve their lives and achieving their **BIGGEST** goals and dreams. Nothing is to big, it all starts with a small step. **Today**.
