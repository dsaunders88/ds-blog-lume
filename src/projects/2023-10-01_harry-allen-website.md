Harry Allen is a seasoned environmental scientist with an extensive background in government agency work, teaching, and research (he's also a good musician; we sing together in choir). He came to me wanting a website that would serve as both a marketing platform for his independent consulting business and as a knowledge platform for sharing his wealth of articles, research, and insights on highly relevant issues relating to climate change and environmental restoration work. The end goal is a combination high-powered blog and marketing site geared toward Harry's unique expertise.

For the visual design, we chose a primary palette of oranges and greens, which signal both the boldness of environmental action and the beauty and resilience of our living planet, enhanced by vibrant complementary colors. The [Astro web framework](https://astro.build/), which positions itself as an ideal framework for building for content-focused websites, fit the bill perfectly for the development build of this project. Paired with the [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) headless CMS platform, the site delivers a fast, SEO-friendly experience with content that is a breeze to update and manage.

Other fun features on the website include scroll animations with [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) and accessible color palettes with [Reasonable Colors](https://reasonable.work/colors/). The project is currently in the development phase, and I'll be excited to share it when it goes live!
