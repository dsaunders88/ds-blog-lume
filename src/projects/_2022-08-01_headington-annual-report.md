[Headington Institute](https://headington-institute.org/) is a small non-profit with a huge global reach, providing "support for supporters" in high-stress environments around the world. The annual report is an important document sent to their donors that details all of the major milestones and accomplishments from the previous year.

I had a lot of fun designing this 6" x 9" print report, which uses a friendly color scheme to complement the organization's bold branding. I also took the lead in sourcing images that seek to convey a global perspective and reach, while avoiding the trap of "Western saviorism" that can all too easily seep into this kind of work.

The result is an impactful presentation of the organization's vision and work.
