## Stockholm

I was born here in October 1990.

First we lived in Gustavsberg, then moved to Hammarbyhöjden.
Since 1999 we have been living in Haninge and 2004 we moved to Dalarö.

I left Stockholm for tertiary studies twice (2009-2016) and (2019-2023).
Since March of 2023 I'm back living in Stockholm.

## Ronneby

I moved to Ronneby when I was 18 years old to start uni. I only lived here for about a year since our campus were closing down and merged with Karlskrona.

## Karlskrona

I lived in Karlskrona from 2010 to April 2016. I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and worked for a few years as a software developer.
I lived in a student dorm and then later in shared apartments with my friends, Micke and Christopher, then with Robin.

## Brisbane

I get asked from time to time why I moved to Australia. There isn't a short and easy answer to that question, except that I both needed and wanted a change to find living more fun.

I took the decision to quit my secure programming career and pursue my passion for music and a Songwriting degree at JMC Academy.

Australia has been my number one travel destination for so long and I had already prepared for departure before getting a confirmation about my enrolment.

I first stayed at a few backpackers hostels before finding a longer term accomodation, then finally settled in at Raymont College in 2020, where I stayed until I left Australia 3 years later.
